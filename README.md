# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Things to highlight

* Developed using React Components, Services. 
* Generic components for the Header, Card, Footer etc., which will reuse throughout the SPA
* Used Lighthouse tool for the performance checks
* Added pagination on page scroll event (The scrolling package helpers used for scroll events which loads default of 50 responses)
* Added the filters for the contact search
* Test cases added for the components
* Responsive web design using fluid media query used for mobile, tab and browsers
* SASS-LESS used for styling
* Screenshot added for test report coverage, Responsive design, website page

## Proposed Ideas/Improvements for future enhancements

* Performance test automation using Webvitals
* Add e2e steps
* Add the tab navigation as per the requirement (Started but not yet completed. Need some more time)

## Behavior
* The contacts should be grouped in tabs - Not completed
* When clicking on a contact, its card should be displayed - Completed
* When clicking on the close button of a card, it should disappear - Completed
* While a contact card is being displayed, if another contact is clicked, the first - Completed
* clicked contact card should disappear - Completed
* Added search filter - Added from user perspective to search the contact list easily
* Added the filter contact by Language/Nationality - Added from user perspective to search the contact list easily
